### Currently Working On, Personal Project:

Baseball's been my passion since I was a kid, bonding me with my late father. Now, I'm digging deep into baseball stats, wondering how today's players really stack up against each other when teams change every year. My project's all about crafting a smarter algorithm that breaks down teams into their 25-player puzzle pieces. Stay tuned, fellow fans; we're rewriting the playbook!
